= Arcade Interactive Lab Walkthrough

This is here for BETA testing only, and will be removed soon. This page is a bit slow to load, there are 7 Arcades, so don't miss out by not scrolling down. 

These embedded interactive experiences provide a guided walkthrough of the end-to-end lab workshop.  At times they can malfunction when run from a small window, they work best in full screen. 

Here are some tips:

 * There is a navigation bar across the top.
 ** use the diagonal arrows at the top right to expand the window. 
 ** use the arrows at the top left to navigate forward or backwards.
 ** in the center of the screen you can restart the Arcade.
 ** the lower section of the screen show video progress or slide progression steps.
